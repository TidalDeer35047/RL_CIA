# Problem Statements

## CIA 1
The problem statement is to develop a system that can effectively identify and prioritize the display of certain "aligned" articles, in order to maximize the total views and thus the value generated for politically and commercially affiliated media companies.

## CIA 2
The problem statement is to create a 100x100 grid with obstacles in between 2 random points, build an MDP based RL agent to optimise both policies and actions at every state, and benchmark the DP method with other RL solutions for the same problem.
