    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "The news value maximizer problem involves a set of politically and commercially affiliated media companies that are tasked with maximizing the views for certain \"aligned\" articles, which are more valuable to them than other articles.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem statement is to develop a system that can effectively identify and prioritize the display of these aligned articles, in order to maximize the total views and thus the value generated for the media companies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The K-armed bandit approach is a viable option for this problem, as it allows the system to balance exploration (trying out different articles to discover their value) and exploitation (focusing on the articles that are known to be more valuable).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Approach\n",
    "Specifically, the system maintains a set of article view counts and associated \"article values\" (representing the relative importance or value of each article to the media companies). It will sometimes explore by randomly selecting an article, and other times exploit by selecting the article with the highest expected value (views * value).\n",
    "\n",
    "As the system runs and displays articles, it updates the view counts and learns more about the relative values of the different articles. Over time, the system will gradually shift towards displaying the more valuable, aligned articles more often, maximizing the total views and value generated for the media companies."
